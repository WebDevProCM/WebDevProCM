### Hey there!
I'm Chamod.

I am a self-learner with a passion for problem-solving and building perfect responsive full-stack web applications. I am always proactive in
learning new concepts and like to explore new technologies emerging in the industry. 

I always like to play games and after doing some work and projects I play games to calm my mind and focus on the goals. I'm looking forward to learning best practices in programming and growing as a full-stack developer.
